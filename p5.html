        Description
      </h1>

      <p>
        Using nested loops and if/else statements I created an optical illusion of a corn field. This practice stems from pattern making, an ancient and culturally diverse practice. 
      </p>
     
      <h1>
         Process Summary
      </h1>

        <p>
      During the ideation and research process, I initially thought about weaving patterns and the work of Anni Albers. She was often inspired by patterns found in nature, and also the weaving of ancient Andeans. Filtering this through my personal lens, I explored mossy terrains, the patterning of algae and lichen. 
        </p>

      <p>
      As I continued my research, I recalled the corn fields of my youth â€” the dizzying rows that animate as you drive by, and enfold you when you walk between the rows. A color field of greens and yellows as the seasons change. The pattern continuing, in a different scale, to the corn cob. Rows of plump golden kernels, or the deep purple and red heirloom varieties. 
       </p>

      <h1>
        Process Detail
      </h1>
      <p> 
        My process was a lot of starts, stops, and explorations as I was working to not ony draw the patterns with p5.js but also create a more compact code through loop formulas. 
      </p>
       <p> My corn field pattern is based on a field of circles, made more complex using elements of the <a href="https://naziafakhruddin.medium.com/creating-illusions-in-p5-js-dynamic-kanizsa-illusion-part-4-af9fe72c5ec7"><mark2>Kanizsa arcs</mark2></a> detailed by Nazia Fakhruddin. I used vibrating magenta and green, combined with deeper greens and yellows to create the seasonal tones of a corn field.

          Reflection
      </h1>
       
           <p>Daisy Ginsberg's <a href="https://pollinator.art"><mark2>Pollinator Art</mark2></a> has long been an inspiration for many of my projects. Participants interact with her work to generate a garden friendly to pollinators. They can then download the plans for the garden to plant in real-life. Her use of colors, interactivity, and shifting the point of view to other species is inpiring. Contemporary agricultural practices are fraught, regarding the use of pesticides and sustainability among other things. A tool like this could help particpants understand the impact on land, environment, and people. </p>
