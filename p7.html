        Description
      </h1>

      <p>
        I designed a game inspired by my lifelong love for reading. As a child, I was encouraged by my family, but also nurtured through some amazing public & school programming like the Reading Rainbow, Book-It!, I Love to Read, Scholastic Book orders, D.E.A.R, and summer library challenges.
      </p>
     
      <h1>
         Process
      </h1>
        <p>
        I experimented with various game ideas based on my memories of these programs. For instance, a player could collect books, and once they fill the screen they win a digital pizza! (Based on the real program Book-It! that rewards you with real pizza if you meet the reading goals!). 
        </p>

        The game featured here was inspired by Reading Rainbow, the television series that made reading feel transportive and magical. While I was coming up with a visual language for my game, I was really drawn to Reading Rainbows opening credits  — a butterfly magically changes objects into the fantastical and imaginary. Or in my instance changes a flower into a book.

        My game features a reading list of books that have been shaping and informing my relationship with nature, with imaginaries of another kind. Featured photos are ones I’ve taken of beautiful landscapes, big and small, near and far; combined with cut out flowers of my family’s weekly bouquet from Luna Farms at the greenmarket.

          Reflection
       </h1>
       
        <p>
         Game play is simple for now. Players mouse over a flower and it turns into a book. Click and the scene changes. Future features list include unique book lists for each scene. I tried but haven’t yet leveled up on my switch statements. This could then span a few genres and players could pick which one to play. 
        </p>

        <p>
        Continuing the project, I’d like to refine the graphics, add more books that could be randomly pulled from, and also experiment with other ways of introducing the books themselves. Quotes from the books might be an interesting way to extend the experience of reading.
