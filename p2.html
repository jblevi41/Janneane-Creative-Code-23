        Description
      </h1>

      <p>
        Continuing explorations of human and computer languages, I asked someone to describe an object that they lost. Human language and memory can tend towards ambiguity, while computer code requires the interpretation to be more precise.

       <p>
        A black stainless steel water bottle that's about 25 cm tall and 8 cm wide. The bottle cap is also black, and it's about 3.5-4 cm wide. There is a silver band running along the bottom of the bottle, about 5 cm from the bottom, and about 4 cm tall. There is a silver handle attached to the lid.

        <p>
       I really appreciated Roshniâ€™s detailed and objective description. The dimensions were super helpful in the next step of translating to code, and also allowed me to get a sense of scale. I had a pretty clear idea of what to expect, but it was still so satisfying seeing that when I plugged these values in that the result very much matched. The main difference I encountered in these depictions was the sliver band. I decided to place it lower to the bottom rather than 5cm above it. I realized that 5cm is 20% of the total height making it more significant than it sounds.
