        Description
      </h1>

      <p>
        My clock uses an animated spiral of ellipses to compare how a child experiences time to how an adult experiences time. As a mother to a toddler, it's really wonderful to see how we gain our understanding of time. I came across a <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/think-well/202011/why-time-goes-faster-we-age"><mark2>study</mark2></a> that explained why one minute feels like forever when you're young, but flys by as you age. Using a frame rate analogy, younger brains are capturing more frames per minute or second, and adult brains are capturing fewer. So in a sense, a child is experiencing more time per minute, and an adult less. A child is often processing experiences or even everyday phenomona for the first time -- they're building and encoding rich context memories. As adults, we already have a bank of memories stored, so we're able to use more lossy ways of experiencing time, calling forth experiences and learned context. 
      </p>
     
      <h1>
         Process Summary
      </h1>

        <p>
      Using a basic spiral function in p5.js, I generated a formula to alter the animation based on age input. Someone younger than 18, will reveal a denser animation reflecting the higher frame rate. Someone older than 18 will generate a faster more sparse dot pattern. 
       </p>

      <h1>
        Process Detail
      </h1>
      <p> I began with a series of pseudocode prompts and sketches to understand how I might visualize or code time. Drawing spirals, circles, lines, and waves lent visual metaphors for makring time.
      </p>
       <p> I selected  the spiral pattern because I felt it readily references the clock. Time passing, repeating, expanding. There's a lot to explore still regarding the speed, frame rate. It would be interesting to build in a steady gradation of how time is experienced by year. I'd also like to build in a reset funtion after one minute, and/or run the animations side by side.

          Reflection
      </h1>
       
           <p> To continue the exercise, I'd love to try an alternate clock that compares the experience of time by humans to plants. I once read that plants experinence time as a wave. I experimented briefly with <a href="https://p5js.org/examples/math-sine-wave.html"><mark2>Daniel Shiffman's sine wave code</mark2></a>; really fantasitc things happen when you change the amplitude and period values. </p>
